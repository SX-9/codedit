# codedit
A Lightweight VSCode Alternative

# Why I Made This?
VSCode Is Too Much For My PC To Handle (_Potato PC_) And I Want A Code Editor That Looks Like VSCode, So I Decided On Atom But Its Being _Discontinued_, So I Made My Own Editor With _Basic Functionality_!

# Still In Development!
This Project Has **A Lot Of Bugs**, If You Want To Fix Them Feel Free To Open A **Pull Request**!

# How To Use:
If You Have Both NodeJS And NPM Installed Then Do:
```bash
npx codedit@latest
```
