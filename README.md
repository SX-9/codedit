# codedit
A Lightweight VSCode Alternative

# Why I Made This?
VSCode Is Too Much For My PC To Handle (Its Just That My PC IS Super Weak) And I Want A Code Editor That Looks Like VSCode, So I Decided On Atom But Its Still Too Slow And Being Discontinued, So I Made My Own Editor With The Features I Need!

# Still In Development!
This Project Is Still Being Developed And No Releases Yet, If You Want To Help Contact Me On Discord (sx9dev#1151)
